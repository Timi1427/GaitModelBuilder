# GaitModelBuilder

This is a library made for creating user profiles and to classify data for the project "LetMeIn" (https://github.com/MilleJanos/GaitBiometrics). This project is under construction. In this part I use the weka library and FeatureExtractor (https://github.com/NemethKrisztian96/FeatureExtractor/) for managing data.

## Installation

Firstly you need a Java compiler, for compiling the .java files from GaitModelBuilder/src/ro/sapientia/gaitbiom/ folder. Or it is easier if you just import in your Java project the GaitModelBuilder.jar.

## Usage

An example for the usage is to take a view at GaitHelperFunctions main class. There appear examples for the right function calls and you could also see the right structure of the files form INPUT_ARFF and INPUT_RAW folders. 

## Support

You can open an issue in the Issues section on Github, or contact the project admin at fuloptimea1427@gmail.com.

## Authors and acknowledgment

This project has been made by Fülöp Timea for a research project, under the careful supervision of prof. dr. Antal Margit from Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania.
